# Zoom API Version 1

This repo is the source code for our documentation. You can view the documentation [here](https://zoom.github.io/api).

Feel free to submit [issues](https://github.com/zoom/api/issues) or fork this repo and contribute changes.

## Getting Started

Zoom exposes REST interfaces which allows the developers and solution providers to manage meetings, users, recordings, settings and get usage reports. These APIs will be useful when you as a solution provider, build your own web portal to front end Zoom services and present as a login point to your end users.

These management APIs are auto-enabled if you have a paid Zoom account. If you donâ€™t have a zoom account, go ahead, create a free account and [sign up](https://zoom.us/signup) for a 60 days free trial of our developer platform
